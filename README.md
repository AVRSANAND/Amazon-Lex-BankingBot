- Custom Intents: Includes various intents such as WelcomeIntent, CheckBalance, and TransferFunds.
- AWS Lambda Integration: Utilizes AWS Lambda for executing backend logic, such as generating a random bank balance.

## Architecture
The Banking Bot uses the following AWS services:

## Prerequisites
